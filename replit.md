## Data Files

- `data/weapons.json` — weapon definitions (production)
- `data/weapons_source.json` — raw weapon source (used by Black Market UI)
- `data/equipment_source.json` — raw gear source (used by Black Market UI)
- `data/character-test.json` — dev seed character "Kael Dawnstrider" (loaded by `server/db.js` on startup, always synced to DB). All disciplines at D12 for testing. All 4 vocations at tier 5. Includes phase trio (War Front / Pacification Survivor / Traumatized) and backgroundFavored disciplines. Format matches expanded character data produced by the creation flow.
- `data/characters.seed.json` — initial character slot names for DB seeding
- `data/armor.json`, `data/gear.json` (55 items: 28 original + 26 marketplace gear + Holo-Journal across tools/tech/medical/survival/surveillance/communication categories, 15-200cr range), `data/chassis.json` — equipment data
- `data/kits.json` — Vocation definitions (Kit System v2). 9 vocations: The Gunslinger (ranged/reflex), The Shockboxer (brawl/physique), The Ghost (stealth/reflex), The Ichor Witch (alter_spark/presence), The Noble (charm/presence), The Investigator (investigation/wits), The Seer (sense_spark/wits), The Altus Sopor (control_spark/grit), The Telekinetic Savant (alter_spark/presence). Each has 5-tier ability tree with typed abilities (passive/gambit/maneuver/exploit/permission), favoredDiscipline, tags, effect tracks, and risk fields. Kit budget is 5 points (1pt per tier). Tier cap enforced by linked discipline die: D4→T1, D6→T2, D8→T3, D10→T4, D12→T5.
- `data/gamesystem.json` — Core resolution rules reference. Includes full 6-tier resolution ladder (Fleeting through Unleashed III), Modes of Play (Combat/Challenge/Narrative), Presence scaling guide, Opening/Exploit/Defense reactive economy framework, Dual Wielding rule, Concealment rule, and Vocation System v2 framework.
- `data/threats.json` — NPC/threat rules and trigger system (pending alignment with Opening/Exploit/Defense model)
- `data/maneuvers.json` — universal actions + discipline gambits (object: `universalActions[15]` incl. Join Battle + Resist, `forceManeuvers[3]` (Centering Focus, Force Sense, Telekinesis), `disciplineGambits{25 sets, 75 gambits}` (Alter gambits: Force Shove D8, Mind Trick D10, Hurl D12), `advancedManeuvers[]`, `vocationManeuvers[14]` — Dead Drop (Gunslinger T3), Slip (Ghost T3), Arise (Ichor Witch T4), True Possession (Ichor Witch T5), Read the Room (Noble T2), Compel (Noble T3), Keen Insight (Investigator T3), Shatterpoint Sense (Seer T3), Shatterpoint Strike (Seer T5), Enhance Attribute (Altus Sopor T2), Force Speed (Altus Sopor T3), Emptiness (Altus Sopor T5), Kinetic Impulse (Telekinetic Savant T1), Kinetic Combat (Telekinetic Savant T3)). Move action has explicit combat tiers. Join Battle uses Free type. Dodge/Endure/Resist are Defense type (free, no Exploit pip cost). Base Alter Telekinesis maneuver is pure object movement (tiered by scale); Kinetic Impulse (push/pull people) moved to Telekinetic Savant vocation. Crush gambit replaced by Hurl gambit (throw lifted objects at targets).
- `data/glossary.json` — 54 entries including 23 conditions + Natural Recovery rule with conditionType/pcEffect/npcEffect fields. All 25 disciplines include `narrativeTiers` (fleeting/masterful/legendary/unleashedI/unleashedII/unleashedIII) for Challenge and Narrative mode outcomes. Consumed by the Player's Handbook panel.
- `data/adventures.json` — structured adventure content (adventures → parts → scenes)

## Running the App

```bash
npm run dev        # nodemon server + Tailwind CSS watch (development)
npm start          # production node server only
npm run css:build  # one-shot CSS build
```

Server listens on `0.0.0.0:5000`.

## API Endpoints

## Ammo Power Bar System

Each ranged weapon in `data/weapons.json` now has a `clipSize` field (ammo capacity). Melee weapons have no `clipSize`.

The weapon card header in both `js/armory-panel.js` and `js/loadout-panel.js` renders a `_buildAmmoBar(clipSize)` function that outputs a segmented 8-bar readout styled like a Star Wars blaster power pack:
- **≥ 75% full** → green (`#22c55e`) with green glow
- **30–75% full** → amber (`#f59e0b`) with amber glow
- **< 30% full** → red (`#ef4444`) with red glow

Bars are stored on DOM elements as `data-clip-size` and `data-ammo-pct` for future ammo-tracking integration. All bars initialize at 100%. CSS class: `.wpn-ammo-bar`, `.wpn-ammo-seg`, `.wpn-ammo-seg-empty`.

**Clip sizes assigned:**
- Hold-outs (Q-2, Happy Surprise, Quickfire-4): 8
- Lightning Gun: 6 (stated in trait)
- DC-15s Sidearm: 20
- Intimidator, KYD-21, Lancer, Luxan, QuickSnap, E-5, DDC Defender, Quick-Six: 50
- Standard rifles/pistols (DL-18, DH-17, Westar, Relby, Bryar, E-11, DC-15 Rifle, EE-3, A280): 100
- DLT-19 (belt-fed): 200

## Carousel System — Character Creation

Character creation uses a unified carousel system (`buildPhaseCarousel` / `phaseCarouselNav` / `phaseCarouselUpdate`) for both the species selection screen and the three-phase background card screens. All carousels use the same flat card layout (`ph-card-wrap ph-card-flat` → `ph3-species-card`) with image-left / text-right layout, header-row nav arrows, dot indicators, keyboard + swipe navigation. Species cards are rendered by `buildSpeciesCardFlat()`; phase cards by `buildPhase3CardFlat()`. Human's 22 favored discipline choices use a `<select>` dropdown; other species (≤5 choices) use pill buttons.

### Phase Cards

Character creation uses a three-phase card selection system in `js/character-creation.js`. Each phase represents a layer of backstory: Foundation (Phase 1), Catalyst (Phase 2), Debt (Phase 3).

**Card counts:** 12 cards per phase (36 total).

**Card images:** All 36 card images live in `assets/phase1/`, `assets/phase2/`, `assets/phase3/`. The full deck was restyled in March 2026 to a unified high-resolution Art Nouveau tarot aesthetic with consistent gold filigree borders and phase-coded color palettes:
- Phase 1 (Foundation): warm amber / sienna / golden earth tones
- Phase 2 (Catalyst): cold steel blue / slate green / military tones
- Phase 3 (Debt): deep crimson / shadow purple / noir tones

No text is baked into the images. All card titles, narratives, and symbols are rendered by the JS from the data arrays.

**Phase 1 cards (foundations / origin):**
`deep-fringe`, `shadowed-levels`, `salvage-yards`, `coreward-spires`, `agrarian-plain`, `war-front`, `ancient-ruin`, `trading-post`, `detention-block`, `shipboard-born`, `labor-camp`, `enclave`

**Phase 2 cards (catalyst / departure):**
`disbanded-regular`, `separatist-holdout`, `imperial-defector`, `blockade-runner`, `pacification-survivor`, `field-medic`, `syndicate-enforcer`, `post-war-tracker`, `purge-survivor`, `wreck`, `ascent`, `betrayal`

**Phase 3 cards (debt / consequence) — each has a named Knack ability:**
`hutt-marked`, `witness`, `traumatized`, `shadow-stalked`, `defector`, `debtor`, `exile`, `addiction`, `false-identity`, `notorious` (The Name), `blood-price` (Dead Reckoning), `hunted` (Prey Sense)

**Gemini AI backstory integration:** Phase 3 knacks and Phase combo selections (e.g. Purge Survivor + Shadow-Stalked + Prescient Kit) feed conditional logic in the Gemini backstory generator. See `_aiMeta.loreAnchors` on species objects and `_meta` on phase cards for the directive fields.

## Destiny Selection + Backstory Generator

Two new screens added after Kit selection (March 2026):

**Destiny Selection (`screen-destiny`):** Two sections:
1. **Pool Contribution** — Player picks Two Light, Light & Dark, or Two Dark. Stored in `state.destiny`. Seeds the group destiny pool and shapes Gemini backstory tone.
2. **Personal Destiny** — Player selects one of 8 Destinies (Destruction, Discovery, Rescue, Creation, Corruption, Atonement, Liberation, Ascendancy). Each is morally neutral with: Hope Recovery (recover spent Hope token once/session), Toll Recovery (recover spent Toll token once/session), and an Advance Trigger (character growth token). Stored in `state.personalDestiny` (full object from `data/destinies.json`). Both pool AND personal Destiny must be selected before Continue enables.

**Data:** `data/destinies.json` — 8 destiny definitions with `name`, `tagline`, `hopeRecovery`, `tollRecovery`, `advanceTrigger`, `narrativeHook`.

**CSS:** `.pd-card` family (`.pd-card-header`, `.pd-card-name`, `.pd-card-tagline`, `.pd-card-details`, `.pd-card-mechanic`), `.pd-label` variants (`--hope`, `--toll`, `--advance`), `.personal-destiny-grid` (4→2→1 col responsive), `.destiny-section` wrappers.

**Your Story (`screen-backstory`):** Form-based backstory generator.
- Fields: Character Name (required, or "Generate for me"), Gender (Male/Female), Species (read-only), Title (optional or generated), optional player input textarea
- Generate button fires only on click — never auto-fires (conserves API quota)
- 5-second minimum display delay enforced via `Promise.all([fetch, 5s])`
- 15-second Regenerate cooldown after each generation
- Clipboard copy uses HTTP-safe fallback (`execCommand`) for local network
- Gemini returns structured JSON (`{ backstory, name?, title? }`) via `responseMimeType: 'application/json'`
- AbortController-style 25-second timeout via `Promise.race`; 429 shows friendly rate-limit message

**Server route:** `POST /api/backstory/generate` in `server/routes/backstory.js`. Uses `@google/generative-ai` SDK. Requires `GEMINI_API_KEY` in Replit Secrets.

**Save route:** `POST /api/characters/save` in `server/routes/characters.js`. Finds first empty slot or creates new. Called from "Confirm & Save" button in the summary overlay.

**Character creation flow (9 steps):** Species → Phase 1 (Origin) → Phase 2 (Catalyst) → Phase 3 (Debt) → Arenas/Disciplines → Vocations → **Outfitting** (500 cr starting budget) → **Destiny** → **Your Story** → Summary (Confirm & Save)

**Step track:** 9 pips in the header track the full flow. Step labels show "Step X of 9" for numbered steps and named headers for phases/destiny/backstory.

## Outfitting Screen

New step added between Kits and Destiny. Players spend 500 starting credits on gear, weapons, and armor from the combined catalog (`data/gear.json`, `data/weapons.json`, `data/armor.json`). Features search, category filters (All/Gear/Weapons/Armor), add/remove cart, credit tracking. Selected gear stored in `state.startingGear[]` and persisted through to summary/save. The standalone Black Market page (`/market/`) continues to work independently for mid-campaign shopping.

**Background Items System:** Phase 1 cards grant 2-3 free items thematically tied to origin. Phase 2 cards grant 1-2 items tied to catalyst. Phase 3 cards grant NO items (debt/burdens only). Vocations grant a signature weapon/tool at Tier 1+. All background items use `acquisition: 'background'` and an `origin` field (e.g. "Deep Fringe", "Disbanded Regular", "The Gunslinger"). Background items are FREE (excluded from `outfittingCreditsSpent()`). Players can sell background items back for half value via `sellBackgroundItem()`, which tracks sold keys in `state.soldBackgroundKeys[]` to prevent re-sell exploits. `initOutfittingScreen()` reconciles background items on every entry (adds new, removes stale from phase changes, skips sold items). The cart shows two sections: "Background Gear" (with origin badges + sell buttons) and "Purchased Gear" (with remove buttons). CSS classes: `.outfitting-acq-badge.background`, `.outfitting-cart-section-head`, `.outfitting-sell-btn`, `.outfitting-cart-row--bg`.

## Campaign Engine

The GM Command Bridge (`public/gm/index.html`) features a full Campaign Engine as its primary tab.

**Data:** `data/adventures.json` — 10 adventures structured as adventures → parts → scenes. Adventures 1-3 have full scene content (37 scenes total) with readAloud text, GM notes, NPC rosters, hazards, decision points, lore tags, and narrative links. Adventures 4-10 have title/part structure only (placeholder).

**DB Tables:** `campaign_progress` (single-row, tracks current adventure/part/scene position), `scene_completion` (per-scene completion status + optional GM notes).

**API Endpoints:**
- `GET  /api/campaign/adventures` — full adventure data
- `GET  /api/campaign/adventures/:id` — single adventure
- `GET  /api/campaign/progress` — current position + all scene completions
- `PUT  /api/campaign/progress` — save position (validated against adventure data)
- `PUT  /api/campaign/scene/:sceneId/complete` — toggle scene completion
- `GET  /api/campaign/lore-tags` — all lore tags with scene references
- `GET  /api/campaign/lore-tags/:tag` — scenes referencing a specific tag
- `GET  /api/campaign/party` — party monitor data from characters table

**UI Features:** Adventure navigator (10 adventures), part navigator, scene list with completion indicators, scene renderer (read-aloud block, GM notes, NPC roster, hazards, decision points), clickable lore tags with cross-reference modal, narrative link navigation, collapsible Party Monitor sidebar, TBD placeholder panels for Combat Tracker and Starship Combat.

## Right Column Layout (frame-right)

The right column (`#frame-right`, 25vw fixed sidebar) serves as the **combat cockpit** — always-visible status regardless of which center panel is active.

**Sections (top to bottom):**
1. **Vitality** (`char-vitality-wrap`) — EKG animation + clickable health pips
2. **Active Effects** (`char-effects-wrap`) — conditions applied by `effect-manager.js`
3. **Engine Pool** (`char-engine-wrap`) — resource pips + core utility only (kit abilities moved to center panel)
4. **Resolution Ladder** (`char-ladder-wrap`) — symmetric fulcrum display showing Roll − Risk = Net result. Success tiers: Fleeting (0–3), Masterful (4–7), Legendary (8–11), Unleashed I (12–15), Unleashed II (16–19), Unleashed III (20+). Unleashed tiers reachable only via favored discipline exploding die or stacked +1 tier effects. Failure tiers mirror below zero. Includes tier modifier sources (+1/−1).

**Action Economy pips** are rendered inline inside the Operational Status section (below Start/End Turn buttons). End Turn automatically resets all pips. Bonuses from kit abilities auto-calculated.

## Database

SQLite database auto-created and seeded on first run at `db/campaign.db`.  
Tables: `characters`, `campaign_state`, `equipment_status`, `sessions`, `campaign_progress`, `scene_completion`.

## Player's Handbook

Full-panel rule reference replacing the old glossary overlay. Accessible from a floating book icon in the player view, or by clicking any discipline/arena/condition name on the character sheet.

**Architecture:** Modular provider system — each data category (Arenas, Disciplines, Conditions) registers as a provider with `getGroups()` and `hasEntry()` methods. Adding new providers (Kits, Species, Gear, Core Rules) requires only writing a new provider object — no panel code changes.

**File:** `js/glossary-overlay.js` (rewritten in-place to maintain script tag compatibility)

**Features:**
- Sidebar with categorized, collapsible index tree (Arenas, Disciplines grouped by arena, Conditions grouped by type)
- Real-time search filtering across all providers (matches name + rule + guide text)
- Full content area with rule text, Spacer's Guide flavor, and maneuver/gambit details for disciplines
- Condition names in rule text (`[Bleeding]`) remain clickable and navigate within the handbook
- All existing `data-glossary-id` click triggers preserved (character panel, maneuvers, armory, loadout)
- Closes via X button, Escape key, or backdrop click

**CSS:** Handbook styles in `css/input.css` under `/* Player's Handbook Panel */` section. Maneuver/gambit card styles retained under `/* Handbook — Maneuver & Gambit card styles */`.

## Responsive Design

Character creation and player sheet are responsive across desktop and tablet viewports:

**Character Creation breakpoints (css/input.css):**
- **≤900px:** Compact header/step track, narrower draft overlay, full-width content containers
- **≤768px:** Draft sheet becomes bottom-anchored bar, backstory layout stacks vertically, extra bottom padding to clear overlay
- **≤700px:** Kit flat cards stack vertically (image above, text below)
- **≤600px:** Phase/species card carousels reduce, destiny grid stacks vertically
- **≤480px:** Compact typography, smaller buttons, minimal step track spacing

**Player Sheet breakpoints:**
- **≤1280px:** Right frame hidden, tab bar shown in left frame, left frame expands to 33vw
- **≤900px:** Left frame fixed at 240px
- **≤768px:** Single-slot center (right slot hidden), simplified navbar

## Crew Destiny Pool

Server-authoritative destiny token pool synced in real-time via Socket.io. Pool size = unique connected crew × 2.

**Server events:**
- `destiny:sync` — broadcasts `{ pool: ['hope'|'toll', ...] }` to all clients on join/disconnect/flip/reset
- `destiny:flip` — GM-only, toggles token at `{ index }` between hope/toll
- `destiny:reset` — GM-only, resets all tokens to hope

**Persistence:** Pool stored in `campaign_state` table (key: `destiny_pool`). Survives server restarts. On reconnect, current pool state sent immediately via `destiny:sync`.

**Player view:** Footer renders tokens dynamically from `destiny:sync` events. Display-only (no click-to-flip). Uses existing force-token CSS (blue = hope, red pulsing = toll).

**GM view:** Destiny bar below header in Command Bridge. Clickable tokens emit `destiny:flip`. Shows Hope/Toll count. Reset button emits `destiny:reset`.

**Files:** `server/sockets/handlers.js` (pool logic), `js/socket-client.js` (player rendering), `public/gm/index.html` (GM controls + styles).

## Deployment

Configured as a **VM** deployment (always-on required for Socket.io persistent connections).  
Build command: `npm run css:build`  
Run command: `node server/index.js`
